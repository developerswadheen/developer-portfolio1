            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                into
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. </p>

            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my grandma how
                to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.
